It wasn't 15min task for sure, but if I had more time I would refactor it a bit yet.
Not happy with reducers, maybe introduce some middleware. Dynamic state of the users would be cool,but it wasn't nesesarry for static and predefined list. Algorithms of elimination could also be improved but I was going for code clarity so it's obvious what is going on.
